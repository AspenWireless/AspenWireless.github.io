# About ISP Nexus

Onboarding and sales should be the most challenging parts of running an ISP, but device management,
customer management, and back-end systems often cause more headaches than they should. With the
introduction of ISP Nexus, your MikroTik, Ubiquiti, pfSense Netgate, Tarana, and other popular
ISP CPE routers can be simultaneously affordable and powerful without requiring complicated setups.

ISP Nexus bundles DHCP, CPE provisioning, customer management, and billing (through Sonar Software) into an easy-to-use package.
