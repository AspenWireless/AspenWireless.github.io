# Plume

Take advantage of our Plume Frontline API integrations to make the most
out of your network's Plume devices.

## MAC Sync

When a Plume device matching one of the specified Plume models is synced
in from Sonar, ISP Nexus will automatically retrieve the MAC address for
the device, then update the device in Sonar with its MAC address. This
allows for easy IP auditing through the Sonar IPAM interface.
