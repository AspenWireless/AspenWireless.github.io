# MikroTik

See how to make the most out of your MikroTik CPE devices.

## Provisioning

Automatically provision CPEs with a click of a button.
1 touch is all that's required to take a CPE from factory default to deployment ready.

Simply select the devices you wish to provision, press <i>Provision Selected</i>,
choose a config, and watch as your devices provision.
This page updates dynamically, meaning you can leave it
open and see the provisioning status update in real-time.

<td>

</td>
<td>
<img src="provision-in-progress.png" alt="Provision in Progress" thumbnail="true"/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Expanding one of these entries will show more detailed information about the device
and its provisioning status. It will also give you some more controls, such as retrying
a device that failed to provision, as well as individually running specific parts
of the provisioning process.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Configs

Save your configurations here for use with the CPE provisioner.
The <i>Device Users</i> section allows you to specify user credentials to be
added to your CPEs during the provisioning process.

Access historical provisioning and configuration details, and easily troubleshoot
issues, ping devices, run commands, and update firmware for any CPE, along
with a variety of other controls.
