# Tools

Use our included tools to supplement your network management capabilities.

## Commands

Run commands on your CPEs to assist with troubleshooting or setup. Simply
select as many devices as you want by entering their IP addresses, typing or
selecting the command you wish to run, and entering valid credentials for
the device(s). The IP and credentials will be automatically entered when
running a command from the Device View page, or rerunning a previously
ran command. Save common commands so you can run them later on without
having to type anything out.

## Advanced Search

Perform searches on everything stored in ISP Nexus from one place. Customers,
managed CPEs, customer contact information, accounts with a specified plan,
even custom Sonar account fields (such as an external account ID)
can be searched on.

## Historical IPs

Get historical IP information to make IP audits a breeze.

## Active Pings

See all active running pings, or add new ones to monitor CPEs on your network.
This page updates dynamically, so you can easily monitor device(s) in the background
while you focus on something else.

## SNMP Walks

SNMP Walk any CPE on your network to retrieve information, optionally
provide an OID for to start the walk from.
