# Sonar

Track the interactions between Sonar and ISP Nexus here.

## Status Aliases

Set aliases for your custom Sonar account statuses. For example,
map a <i>Non-Pay</i> Sonar status to the <i>Inactive</i> status in ISP Nexus.

## API Status

The API Status page tracks active API requests between Sonar and ISP Nexus.
It also shows customer accounts that are actively being updated, as well
some historical information about previous requests.

## Overrides

Set hard overrides for specific devices synced in from Sonar. This will
tell ISP Nexus to use the given override instead of the information stored
in Sonar for the specified MAC/Serial number.
