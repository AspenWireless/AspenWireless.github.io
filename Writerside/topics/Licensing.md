# Licensing

ISP Nexus licenses are tracked through your machine ID in order
to ensure users aren't sharing a license. You must submit
your machine ID online in order to authorize your machine to use ISP Nexus.

## Finding your Machine ID

<p>
    If you already have ISP Nexus installed, you can get your machine ID without having a license setup yet.
    Navigate to <control>Administration → Settings → LicensingServer</control> and your machine ID
    will be displayed here, assuming ISP Nexus is running.
</p>

Otherwise, get it from your terminal:

<list>
<li>Assuming you are running ISP Nexus on the recommended operating system (Ubuntu 24.10 LTS or newer),
your machine ID is located in a file at <code>/etc/machine-id</code></li>
<li>The command <code>cat /etc/machine-id</code> will print out your machine ID in the terminal</li>
</list>

## Submitting your Machine ID

<p>
    Submit your <a href="https://aspenwireless.net">machine ID here</a> and
    it will automatically be added to our licensing server.
