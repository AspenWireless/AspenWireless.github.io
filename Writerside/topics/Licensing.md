# Licensing

ISP Nexus licenses are tracked through your machine ID in order
to ensure users aren't sharing their license. You must submit
your machine ID online in order to authorize your machine to use ISP Nexus.

## Finding your Machine ID

<p>
    If you already have ISP Nexus running, you can get your machine ID without having a license setup yet.
    Navigate to <control>Administration → Settings → LicensingServer</control> and your machine ID
    will be displayed here.
</p>

Otherwise, get it from your terminal:

<list>
<li>Assuming you are running ISP Nexus on the recommended operating system (Ubuntu 24.10 LTS or newer),
your machine ID is located in a file at <code>/etc/machine-id</code></li>
<li>The command <code>cat /etc/machine-id</code> will print out your machine ID in the terminal</li>
</list>

## Submitting your Machine ID

<p>
    Submit your machine ID <a href="https://aspenwireless.net">here</a> and it will automatically be added to our licensing server.
